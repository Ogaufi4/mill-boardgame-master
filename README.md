The Rules:

You win the board game if your opponent has only two stones left, or if he cannot move. 
There are three phases in the game (one set-up phase and two move phases). 
In every phase, you can capture if you make three in a row (horizontal or vertical and diagonally ), this is called a 'mill'. 
If you form a mill, you must capture an opposing stone of your choice 
(except when this stone is part of a mill and your opponent has other stones which are not part of a mill).
